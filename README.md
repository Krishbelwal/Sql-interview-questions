# SQL Interview Questions Practice

This repository contains SQL interview questions that I have practiced for learning and interview preparation.  
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, demonstrate my problem-solving approach, and share interview-style SQL queries for reference.

---

## Purpose
- Practice real-world SQL queries commonly asked in interviews.  
- Understand and implement different SQL concepts: joins, subqueries, aggregates, window functions, and more.  
- Maintain a record of my SQL learning journey.

---

## Question Sets

### `question_set_1.sql`
This file contains the first set of SQL questions that I solved.  
Some of the topics covered include:  

- Finding duplicate records  
- Employees earning more than their manager  
- Employees joined in the last 6 months or specific year  
- Departments with no employees  
- Aggregations, min/max, counts per department/job title  
- Second highest salary  
- Top performing locations and cumulative sales  
- Customers with multiple large transactions  
- Customers with no purchases in last 6 months  
- Most profitable region


---

## How to Use
- Open the `.sql` file to view the questions and corresponding queries.  
- You can practice by running these queries on your own database or sample datasets.  
- Add more questions over time to continue building the repository.

---

## Notes
- The queries are written assuming tables like `Employee`, `Customer`, `Orders`, `Transaction`, `Sales`, and `Product`.
